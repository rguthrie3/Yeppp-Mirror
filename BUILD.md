Building on this branch has only been tested on Mac OS X.

To build:

$ ./configure.py -p <your platform>

This generates the build.ninja file, for use with the Ninja build system.
Then:

$ ninja

A substantial amount of the project is generated during the build process from the yaml files in the specs/ directory.

* Public C headers
* CPU Dispatch tables (tables that contain each available implementation, and are used to select the right implementation for the given host)
* CPU Dispatch table headers (needed for the initialization functions)
* Initialization functions (functions that use the dispatch tables to select the right implementation, called by yepLibrary_Init())
* Default implementations (C++ implementations of every function that can be used as a fallback if no asm implementation is detected for the host)
* Unit tests
* Headers for ASM implementations as well as JSON metadata files for use in the dispatch tables, generated by PeachPy
